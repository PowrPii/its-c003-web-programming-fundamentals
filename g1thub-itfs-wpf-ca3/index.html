                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating intelligent systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. It involves the development of algorithms, models, and computer programs that enable machines to learn from data, make decisions, and solve complex problems. AI encompasses various subfields, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. Its applications range from virtual assistants and self-driving cars to healthcare diagnostics and e-commerce, with the potential to revolutionize industries and enhance our daily lives.

                    Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of modern society, with its applications ranging from healthcare to manufacturing to transportation. AI is defined as the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, and decision-making. While AI has brought numerous benefits to our lives, there are also concerns about its negative impacts, such as job displacement and bias in decision-making algorithms. In this article, we will explore both the positive and negative impacts of AI on our lives. <a class="read-more" href="future.html">Read more here.</a>
