                Healthcare is the preservation of mental and physical health by preventing or treating illness through services and effort made by trained and licensed professionals. Healthcare is mainly conducted in a sterile environment like a hospital where doctors, nurses, therapists, and other healthcare professionals reside. These hospital residents provide a spectrum of services and interventions that promote, maintain and restore their patient's health. Hospitals also provide specialized fields like cardiology, oncology, and mental health branches that provide specific assistance to their patient's physical and mental well-being. Overall, healthcare is made up of a spectrum of services that each play a crucial role in promoting health, preventing illness, and managing existing conditions for the benefit of humans.

            <h2>Applications of AI in Healthcare</h2>
            <p>
                In the healthcare sector, AI is playing a big role in assisting doctors, nurses, and patients making their lives easier. AI facilitates workflow efficiency, assists doctors in providing diagnosis, and interacts with patients which will overall improve the hospitals efficiency and improve patient morale.
            </p>
            <h3>- Heathcare Chatbots and Virtual Assistants</h3>
            <p>
                When it comes to AI applications in healthcare, there are commonly used applications that interact with the users frequently like chatbots or virtual assistants. Chatbots and virtual assistants are tools and programming working together to allow a computer to have a conversation with its users allowing easy tasks to be handled without the need for a human operator. 
            </p>
            <h3>- AI Technology for Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
            <p>
                Besides AI that interacts with people, there are AI applications that provide diagnosis and treatments such as the integration of artificial intelligence into wellness and personalized medicine. AI powered wellness is the use of AI technology in healthcare and wellness. Using data analysis and algorithms, it allows personalized treatment plans, optimizes health and wellness plans, and predicts outcomes. 
            </p>
            <h3>- AI-powered Appointment Scheduling Software</h3>
            <p>
                AI applications also affect workflow efficiency in healthcare. AI powered appointment scheduling software is becoming more common and easy to implement, allowing for a significant improvement in workflow efficiency especially in hospitals as they operate 24/7. An increase in workflow efficiency also achieved with its data analysis and decision support that distributes patient priority so that doctors and focus on the patients with dire needs before attending to patients that are less of an emergency.

            <h2>Benefits of AI in Healthcare</h2>
            <h3>- Improved Patient Engagement</h3>
            <p>
                Using AI to conversate with their patient allows for improved patient engagement as their conversations with AI will be more personalized, making them feel more comfort and involved in their healthcare. AI will also provide increased efficiency and cost effectiveness as chatbots are able to manage a large volume of patient inquires unlike its human counterpart that only is able to handle one patient at a time while being paid hourly. Lastly, chatbots can be accessed anytime, allowing patients to still be able to interact with their healthcare provider in the event they have a question of are in a medical emergency.
            </p>
            <h3>- Better Healthcare Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                An example of AI technology that provides diagnosis and treatment plans is the software called AI powered wellness. AI powered wellness identifies patterns and trends by analysing large datasets of patient information to allow healthcare professionals to get a deeper understanding of the patient and make better decisions. An example of AI powered wellness is the use of wearable devices that allow the patient and healthcare professional to closely monitor the wearer's daily activities and health metrics. This allows for the patient to follow closely according to the routine instructed by the healthcare provider and in turn allows the healthcare professional to view valuable insights on their treatment plan. AI powered wellness is also developing predictive models which can track certain patients that are at risk of developing specific illnesses so that medical professionals will have the opportunity to tackle the early onset of the illness before it worsens. These developments in AI will allow better patient satisfaction and better diagnosis from healthcare professionals allows a significant improvement of the entire healthcare system.
            </p>
            <h3>- Better Workflow Efficiency</h3>
            <p>
                A method that AI applications improve workflow efficiency is by automating the process of ordering medications and supplies that reduce human errors and improve patient safety. This frees up the nurses and doctors for more patient-centric tasks. Additionally, with the use of AI scheduling software, administrative tasks can be automated like scheduling appointments and processing insurance claims which allows doctors and nurses to spend more time attending to patients.

            <h2>Challenges of AI in Healthcare</h2>
            <h3>- AI replacing Healthcare Workers</h3>
            <p>
                With these benefits that AI provide us, there are also drawbacks such as AI replacing human jobs in masses. If chatbots and virtual assistants become more commonly used, the need for jobs that require a human present like Information desks, medical schedulers, medical billers, and patient service representatives will cease to exist causing a significant amount of people to lose their jobs. 
            </p>
            <h3>- AI Affecting Safety</h3> 
            <p>
                When it comes to AI that provides diagnosis and treatments, it is important to note that AI can potentially give the wrong information on its patients that might affect their safety. AI does not consider if it has false negatives or false positives and allowing their predictions to determine a patient's health can have serious consequences. AI is also taught with a large data set, however, change of environment or circumstance might make the AI's data unreliable, leading it to make erroneous predictions. 
            </p>
            <h3>- Depersonalization of care</h3>
            <p>
                Overreliance on AI in the healthcare industry could lead to impersonal interactions and a decline in empathy and human connection.  Patients might feel neglected by the doctors if chatbots and virtual assistants are the ones that are consistently relaying information to them instead of the doctors themselves. This creates an environment where there is a disconnect between patients and their care providers causing a gap in the relationship between doctors and patients.
