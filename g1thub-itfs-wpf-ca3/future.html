                AI in the future has the potential to bring about many positive changes in our economy, ranging from increased access to education to enhanced productivity. Now, although its functions and benefits are limited, overtime AI would improve as it gains new capabilities and functions. With its current value of approximately 100 billion USD, it is projected to increase up to twentyfold, just showing AI's sheer importance and value to our economy.

            <h2>Positive Future Impact</h2>
            <h3>- Improved Education</h3>
            <p>
                AI can be further utilized in education with its ability to enhance learning, assist teachers and fuel more effective individualized learning. Through enhanced classroom engagement, such as immersive virtual reality developed by AIs with technologies and assistive technology for special needs, providing speech-to-text and text-to-speech, they can support students with disabilities to learn better with inclusiveness. These are just some ways AIs can be utilized in the education field.
            </p>
            <h3>- Better Healthcare System</h3>
            <p>
                AI can help advance healthcare, improve its efficiency, accuracy and patient outcomes. AI can be used in clinics to provide clinicians with real-time data to support diagnosis and treatment decisions. Alongside, they can provide predictive analysis to identify potential health risks in advance and recommend preventive measures, enhancing efficiency.
            </p>
            <h3>- More Immersive Entertainment</h3>
            <p>
                Implementation of AI in the entertainment industry can increase creativity and generate new ideas.

            <h3>- Security Risks</h3>
            <p>
                AI systems are vulnerable to attacks which makes them a prime target for perpetrators, people can exploit these vulnerabilities for nefarious purposes. As the AI goes through changes with system training, hackers can target the vulnerabilities in these systems. This makes AIs extremely susceptible to data breaches.
            </p>
            <h3>- Weaponization of AI</h3>
            <p>
                 AI could be used in conjunction with harzardous autonomous systems operable from far away. These weapons pose a significant threat to the safety and security for the people around them. Therefore as AI continues to evolve, the need for effective governance mechanisms to manage its use, and mitigate potential hazards, grows.
